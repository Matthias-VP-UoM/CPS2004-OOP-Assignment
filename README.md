## Content organisation

On the root of the repository there are separate folders for each of the tasks (i.e. task1, task2, etc.). Then, depending on the task, there are subfolders showing the answer for the corresponding part of the task being tackled. For example, on the task1 folder there are two subfolders called task1b and task1c respectively. If two subsequent parts of each task make use of one programming language, for example in task 2, then the two parts are combined into 1 single subfolder.
